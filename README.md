## Description

* HD sounds remade from the ground up with the original samples that Valve used in Half-Life
* All sounds are higher quality and in stereo
* Without stuttering or noise
* Some sounds that looped have been fixed to make the loop smoother


## Credits (sorry if I missed someone or made a mistake, please let me know!)

* All sounds were gathered by the great community at Valve Games Sound Origins discord. These sounds come mostly from their original, raw sources that Valve used in Half-Life, 100% fidelity. Others have been enhanced through AI.
* Garompa (small edits for fixing, and choosing which sounds resembled the originals more, and filtering those that sounded bad)
